# DISCRIPTION

Below you will find a dataset for used_car sale prices along with other information about the cars. 
Create and train a linear regression model from scratch to predict the sale price of the cars.

There are two csv files given, train.csv and test.csv. Use the train.csv file to train your model, and use the model to predict the prices of the cars in the test.csv file, and output the accuracy you get. Do not use the test file to train your model.
